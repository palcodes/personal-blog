# Hi, I'm Aayush

I'm a product engineer currently building for [Pashi](https://pashi.com) & for [myself](https://github.com/palcodes). I like to play the product role in a team, pretty much all the way from making design decisions to building the raw application to taking it to production. While this seems like a task, I can achieve all of these with a bunch of good people.

I've built a couple of apps that I am proud of, each one defining a step in the process of learning. I keep finding myself in situations where I need to go back to a concept that I learnt at a point to come to a solution, but now I've no reference to that memory or procedure to reach to a similar solution. I consider myself as someone who likes to write, but more often than not ends up in the **think-plan-wish** loop. But today is one of those days when I shut up and do what I set out to do that goes more like **think-plan-do-iterate**.

While constantly juggling through all kinds of emotions, experiences that life has to throw at me and trying to find my path through all of it, I feel connected, resolved when I come across articles that really inspire me in the most grounded of ways, providing the most practical of approaches to forming a constructive habit. One such is [Linus's blog](https://thesephist.com). I'm using his theme [Carlisle](https://carlisle.thesephist.vercel.app) as a base for my blog as it hit the right chords for what I currently require for my writing needs.

I want this blog to be a public collection of my musings about life, tech, coffee, football and everything in between.
