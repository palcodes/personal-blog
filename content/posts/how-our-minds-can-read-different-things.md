People like to read. Be it while travelling or sitting in the balcony or heck even in a pool. What is really interesting to me is how sometimes your mind just wanders off in a chain of it's thoughts and might misread/extra read into certain words.

Like this little part from linus.coffee/note/having-ideas/, where I read the word *mental desk* as *metal desk* because in my mind, I've been on and off trying out different kinds of note taking tools, methods and the *metal desk* would mean a physical paper and pen set up to do so.
